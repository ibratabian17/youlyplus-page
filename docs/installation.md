\## Method 2: Manual Installation (For Chrome)



Since YouLy+ is not currently on the Chrome Web Store, you can install it manually using the official releases from GitHub.



\### Step 1: Download the Latest Release



1\.  Go to the official \*\*\[YouLy+ Releases Page](https://github.com/ibratabian17/YouLyPlus/releases)\*\*.

2\.  Look for the latest version (it will be at the top and marked "Latest").

3\.  Under the release's \*\*Assets\*\* section, download the `.zip` file intended for Chrome (e.g., `youlyplus-vX.X.X-chrome-edge.zip`).



\### Step 2: Extract the ZIP File



1\.  Locate the downloaded `.zip` file on your computer.

2\.  Extract its contents to a \*\*permanent location\*\*. Good places are your `Documents` or `My Computer` folder. Do not use your `Downloads` folder, as files there are often deleted.



> \*\*Important:\*\* Do not delete this folder after installation. Chrome needs to access these files to run the extension.



\### Step 3: Load the Extension in Chrome



1\.  Open Google Chrome.

2\.  Navigate to the Extensions page by typing `chrome://extensions` in your address bar and pressing Enter.

3\.  In the top-right corner, enable \*\*"Developer mode"\*\* by clicking the toggle switch.



&nbsp;   



4\.  A new menu will appear. Click the \*\*"Load unpacked"\*\* button.

5\.  A file selection window will open. Navigate to and select the \*\*folder\*\* you just extracted in Step 2.

6\.  Click \*\*"Select Folder"\*\*.



YouLy+ is now installed! You will see its card appear on your Extensions page.

\## How to Update a Manually Installed Extension



Manually installed extensions do not update automatically. Follow these steps to update to a new version.



1\.  \*\*Download the new version\*\* from the \[YouLy+ Releases Page](https://github.com/ibratabian17/YouLyPlus/releases), just like you did during the initial installation.

2\.  \*\*Extract the new `.zip` file\*\* into the \*exact same location\* as the old version. When prompted, choose to \*\*"Replace all files"\*\* or \*\*"Overwrite"\*\*.

3\.  Navigate back to the Chrome Extensions page (`chrome://extensions`).

4\.  Find the YouLy+ card and click the \*\*reload icon\*\* (a circular arrow). This will load the new version.

&nbsp;   

5\.  It's a good idea to also refresh your YouTube Music tab to ensure the update takes effect.



\## Troubleshooting



\*   \*\*"Manifest file is missing or unreadable" Error:\*\* This typically means you selected the `.zip` file instead of the extracted folder during Step 3. Make sure you have extracted the folder first and are selecting the folder itself.

\*   \*\*Extension Doesn't Work:\*\*

&nbsp;   \*   On the `chrome://extensions` page, ensure the YouLy+ toggle switch is turned on.

&nbsp;   \*   Go to your YouTube Music tab and perform a hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R on Windows/Linux, Cmd + Shift + R on Mac).

&nbsp;   \*   If it still fails, try restarting your browser.
